🎙️ Voice Assistant: Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text & Voice-Based Calculations
Welcome to my AI-based voice assistant project! This interactive Python application allows users to convert speech to text, text to speech, and even perform arithmetic calculations using voice commands. It integrates various NLP and speech technologies into a simple yet functional notebook.

🔧 Features
🎤 Speech-to-Text: Converts audio input into text using SpeechRecognition.

🗣️ Text-to-Speech: Converts text responses back into audio using gTTS.

➗ Voice-Based Arithmetic: Speak arithmetic operations like "45 divided by 5" and get real-time answers.

🌍 Multi-language Support: Integrated with Google Translate for language flexibility.

📊 Output Display: Outputs are printed and played back for an interactive experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used
